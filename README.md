# BookIt-GrabIt
A sample E-commerce website which I developed in the Avnet's Hackathon Event - Codes & Gears.

As part of the hackathon event - Codes & Gears - which took place at Avnet Technology solutions. 
I created a sample E-commerce application which primarily focusses on the E-commerce problem of validating if the product
would suit a customer's requirements.

Especially in the fabric E-commerce segment - there are always returns in the product since it doesn't fit the customer. 
Hence, have designed a sample web application using JSP, Servlets and MySQL to overcome this issue.

The solution is attained by getting the user's dimensional data and thereby comparing it with the fabric 
using a model to validate it.
